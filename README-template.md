## My process
That's my first attempt after following the HTML and CSS free courses on CodeCademy. I discover the "style-guide.md" at the end, so the scales are not perfect.

### Built with

- Semantic HTML5 markup
- CSS custom properties


### What I learned

I learn so much basics by doing this thing. The using <divs> has containers, shadows, using of text-align and justify. I expect I used every "proprieties" correctly ahah, not sure.
Get some trouble uploading on GitHub, i need to improve this.
